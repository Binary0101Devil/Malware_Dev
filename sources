This is a project created to make it easier for malware analysts to find virus samples for analysis, research, reverse engineering, or review.  Malware can be tricky to find, much less having a solid understanding of all the possible places to find it,  This is a living repository where we have attempted to document as many resources as possible in order to make your job easier.  Please be sure to exercise EXTREME CAUTION when handling these files because as you well know, they have been designed and developed with malicious intent by their original authors.  We believe in transparency and helping the good guys have the right access and tools they need to rip these malicious files apart.

**We welcome all requests and contributions!**

**Please remember that these are live and dangerous malware! Do NOT run them unless you are absolutely sure of what you are doing! They are to be used only for educational purposes only. !!!**

We highly recommend reviewing these files in a pristine sandboxed environment or in a dedicated Virtual Machine that has no Internet access.  If you are not careful, you **will infect yourself or others with dangerous malware!!!**
